# Project-7-Interactive-Video-Player
----
This is my seventh project for Treehouse Techdegree: Front End Developer.

**Project Notes:**
* Validated HTML, CSS validates all but allowed vendor prefixes and pseudo-elements, JS Hint gives no warnings
* Tested on a Mac with Safari 9.1.1 (11601.6.17), Chrome 51.0.2704.63, Firefox 46.0.1
* Attempted to hit all exceeds criteria
  * Embedded .vtt track with caption on/off button
  * Added 10-sec Rewind button to meet "other helpful controls" criteria
  * Volume up/down controls
  * Buffering progress bar added. Note: Short video loads quickly. To see buffering bar in action, throttle network speed. :)
  * Interactive transcript implemented; clicking on transcript sentence resets playhead to correct place in video
  * Responsive design: Reduced control set in small mobile sizes w/ portrait orientation; in phone sizes, landscape orientation hides 
    transcript text while portrait retains it. Font size, text-hovers, and other layout adjustments for tablets and larger desktops.
    * The responsive design part was surprisingly very challenging; hard to find examples of this type of video/transcript and what
      designs might be best used to implement, so I did something basic and just what I thought made sense.

**Needs Work, Need to Learn, and Thoughts:**
* Hovered control sets in mobile devices require taps to open and close - need to find a better implementation than I did. It's 
  not deal breaking for me, but feel like maybe something more elegant is possible.
* Firefox is proving to require a lot of extra time to ensure compatibilty. But I am starting to resolve issues much faster than before
  as my troubleshooting improves.
* This is my second JS project and I committed to writing without jQuery or any other libraries. I'm glad I did. I understand 
  things much more than when I wrote Project 4, and learned an incredible amount from this single project. My confidence with JS
  is higher now and I am able to conceptualize how to structure code more easily.

~Time to complete: 2 weeks, 2 days. This was a very time consuming project due to the amount of new (to me) information needed to learn.
